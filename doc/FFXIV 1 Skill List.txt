abl (Abilities)

Note: 
Ability names with a "?" behind them mean they are abilities that might have never been used in the game, but are in the data files and are mostly unrecognizable.
Ability names with a "??" behind them mean they are abilities in the game, but were used a long time ago and I can't remember if it is the right ability or not.
Ability names with a "???" behind them mean that they might not have names in game so I tried describing them or had a name that I made up by using Final Fantasy names or just clues to name it.

0502: Steal?
0503: Emnity Increase (of some kind???)

0564: Roaming Soul
0565: Decoy
0566: Trance Chant
0567: Purge
0568: Spiritbind / Spiritsong / Parsimony (different names for the same kind of skill!)

0573: Contagion
0574: Manaward???
0575: Invigorate
0576: Paradigm Shift
0577: Foes Requium??? (I'm surprised this isn't in the data files. This looks exactly like a Foes Requim... There are only a couple hidden gems of bard songs in here!)
0578: Looks like an invigorate of some kind???
0579: Plant Landmine/Time bomb??? ( Arcanist was supposed to be a trap class, which would have been freaking awesome. This further suggests their skillset was mostly abilities that costed MP. There are several abilities that have a similar mark or symbol as this in the animation too.)
0580: Punishing Barbs
0581: Bloodbath
0582: Bloodbath II
0583: Aegis Boon
0584: Aegis Boon II
0585: Aegis Boon III (wierd, this doesn't show up in the move files in the game; not even the secret ones!)
0586: Quickstride??
0587: Chocobostride??? Swiftsong old??? (another bard song that looks like a "swiftsong" type ability.)
0589: Manawall??? (I really like the look of this ability for some reason! Also it shows that Arcanist symbol in the animation and there are a couple shortly after it that have the same thing too.)
0590: Ambidexterity
0591: Buff Trap??? (This looks like a trap planted on the caster's feet exclusively or on a single target. It looks like they'll get a transfer trap skill later on.)
0593: Distortion??? (looks like a 1 second blue circle then it blurs a little bit. No idea what this is)
0598: Return Trap??? (This looks like it returns the trap previously placed back to the caster)
0599: Detonation / Homing Missle??? (This looks like a trap on top of the user is detonating and going to an enemy. This could also be just a homing trap/missle.
0600: Provoke (new effect is now more orange than before)
0601: Provoke II (this was the tier II to the old animation of provoke)
0604: Warmonger
0605: Warmonger II
0612: Accomplice
0613: Accomplice II
0614: Quelling Strike (large)
0615: Quelling Strike II
0616: Subtle Release
0617: Sublte Release II (not in ingame move files either for some reason)
0618: Collusion
0619: Collusion II
0624: Transfer Trap??? (this move probably transfers the BuffTtrap to an ally when the trap is at your feet. I really like how this ability looks, especially transfering to a different target.)
0625: Healing Trap??? (I really love how this looks too. This looks like a healing trap that can go on the caster or an ally or multiple allies. This was also the base for Blissful Mind and it was shortened.)
0626: Stun ability??? (this literally looks like like a puff of pink sparkles, but it kinda looks like a stun move. I'm not sure what else to call it!)
0627: Stun II ability???
0630: Line of Fire
0631: Line of Fire II

0634: Raging Strike II

0638: Outmaneuver II
0639: Ferocity II
0640: Defender II

0643: Rampart III
0644: Scavenge II
0645: Hawk's Eye II
0646: Taunt II
0647: Taunt III
0648: Sentinel II
0649: Featherfoot II
0650: Featherfoot III (I like the sound effect this one makes)
0651: Enduring March II
0652: Foresight II
0653: Foresight III
0654: Disorient II
0655: Comrade in Arms II
0656: Speed Surge II

0660: Barbaric Yawp II
0661: Decoy II
0662: Invigorate II
0663: Invigorate III
0664: Quickstride II (this sounds like swiftsong's noise and part of it is used for its effect!)
0665: Distortion II???

0667: Blindside III
0668: Raging Strike III

0693: Blissful Mind
0694: Excruciate
0695: Necrogenesis
0696: Flash (ability)
0700: Chainspell II (was supposed to be Presence of Mind because it's grouped up with the other new class and job abilities. I also like calling it Chainspell II though because it looks more like that.)
0709: Hallowed Ground
0711: Collusion (new) / Punishing Barbs II (this also looks like a Punishing Barbs II also and it could have been the actual animation of that, but it was only debuted in the game as the new Collusion)
0712: Hundred Fists
0713: Divine Veil 
0714: Vengence 
0715: Antagonize
0716: Mighty Strikes

0720: Fists of Wind
0721: Battle Voice
0722: Presence of Mind (this is what it's real animation was supposed to be. Not sure why they had to make a different copy of the Chainspell animation and place It somewhere else and rename it.)
0723: Benediction
0724: Convert
0725: Cover (again)
